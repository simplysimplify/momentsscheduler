# momentsscheduler

Goals:

- The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

* I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

* When I click into a timeblock I can enter an event and save it

* The text for events is saved in local storage and is recalled on reload
